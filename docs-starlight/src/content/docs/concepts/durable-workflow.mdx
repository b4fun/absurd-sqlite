title: Durable Workflow
---

See here for a detailed answer from [ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking][chatgpt_definition].

Durable workflow let developers express long-running, complex workflows reliably.
The key differentiator is that the workflow runtime persists execution progress/state
(often as checkpoints or event history) to durable storage, so the workflow can
resume safely after failures, crashes, or restarts.

## Why Durable Workflow?

Durable workflow is helpful for processes that require longer execution times
(minutes instead of milliseconds), and/or involve complex state management.
Instead of maintaining complex state bookkeeping in application code, durable workflow
encourages developers to express workflows as a series of tasks/activities and
capture the deterministic state transitions. As a result, workflows become easier
to recover/retry and update over time.

### When Not to Use Durable Workflow

Durable workflow might not be a good fit for the following scenarios:

- Short-lived processes.
- Latency sensitive applications.
- Applications leverage non-deterministic/ side-effect operations heavily.

## How Durable Workflow Helps in LLM Agency

LLM agents by nature are long-running processes and require complex state management
retries and recovery from failures. Durable workflows provide a strong foundation for
agent orchestration by decomposing agent behavior into smaller tasks, persisting execution
state/history, and enabling safe resumption, retries, and compensation across failures.
This turns agent execution into a fault-tolerant process rather than a best-effort script.
