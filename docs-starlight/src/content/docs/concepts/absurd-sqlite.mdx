title: Absurd SQLite
---

Absurd SQLite is a SQLite based durable workflow. It based on the implementation
from [earendil-works/absurd][]. Instead of using Postgres, this project uses
SQLite as a lightweight alternative to provide fast and easy-to-use integration.

Absurd SQLite is a project consists of three parts:

- [SQLite extension][absurd-sqlite-extension] that implements the durable workload
  logic by wrapping SQLite built-in features.
- [Language SDKs][absurd-sdks] for writing and invoking the workflows in your favorite language.
- [Standalone application][absurd-standalone] for managing the workflow queues and tasks.

This project aims to provide out-of-box experience for writing and running durable
workflows in local environments (your laptop or homelab) or on a single VM instance (fly.io, Render).
Common use cases include local LLM agents, personal automation scripts, and small
scale backend processing services.

## Comparison with Absurd

Absurd SQLite is inspired by Absurd and follows the similar design principles like
putting the main logic in the database layer. However, due to the nature of SQLite
which has no long running server process, Absurd SQLite expects the users to invoke
and orchestrate workflows via a single writer process. This could be a limitation
for large scale applications, however, it should be sufficient for local / small
scale use cases. {/* link to use cases */}

direction: right

Absurd: {
  worker_a: Worker in Typescript
  worker_b: Worker in Python
  postgres: Postgres Database
  absurd: Absurd Schema & Functions

  worker_a -> postgres: invokes
  worker_b -> postgres: invokes
  postgres -> absurd: executes
}

Absurd SQLite: {
  worker_c: Worker in Typescript
  sqlite: SQLite Database
  absurd_sqlite: Absurd SQLite Schema & Extension

  worker_c -> sqlite: invokes
  sqlite -> absurd_sqlite: invokes
}
